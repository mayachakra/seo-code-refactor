# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Your Task

In this program, we took a pre-existing site and altered it for SEO optimization to ensure the most efficient and up to date version of the site as well as improving accessibility.
In this challenge a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.


Challenge requirements:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Contribution
Created a github repository and utilized github pages to launch the site.
Edited code in html and css for seo optimization with changes such as:
- Adding color to the footer
- Renaming the title
- alt text to images
- relinking the menu items to lead to that section of the page
- Utilizing terminal to add and push these changes
